# Spawn Requirements Analysis

## Overview
The spawn operation for the SceneScout project requires creating a sophisticated multi-agent system to handle various aspects of the event discovery application. Based on the project structure and configuration, this analysis outlines the technical requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

## Context Analysis

### Project Type
- **Application**: SceneScout - Event discovery platform
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.5 with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Features**: Real-time event discovery, map-based search, API integrations
- **Configuration**: Claude-Flow enabled with advanced features

### Current State
- Project has both Next.js app (`/src`) and Vite app (`/vite-app`) implementations
- Extensive API integration setup for multiple event sources
- Database schema and migrations in place
- Claude-Flow configuration with parallel execution and smart auto-spawning enabled

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Agent Types Required
Based on the project structure and needs:

#### Core Development Agents
- **Backend Developer**: Handle API integrations, database operations
- **Frontend Developer**: Manage React/Next.js UI components
- **Database Architect**: Optimize Supabase schema and queries
- **API Integration Specialist**: Coordinate multiple event source APIs

#### Testing & Quality Agents
- **Test Engineer**: Implement Jest tests, integration testing
- **Performance Analyzer**: Monitor and optimize application performance
- **Security Auditor**: Review auth flows and API security

#### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **CI/CD Engineer**: Setup deployment pipelines
- **Edge Function Developer**: Manage Supabase edge functions

### 2. Topology Configuration
Based on `claude-flow.config.json`:
- **Recommended**: Hierarchical topology (as per defaultTopology)
- **Max Agents**: 10 (as configured)
- **Execution**: Parallel strategy enabled
- **Features**: All advanced features enabled (neural training, bottleneck analysis, etc.)

### 3. Coordination Requirements
- **Memory Management**: Cross-session memory enabled for state persistence
- **GitHub Integration**: Enabled for version control coordination
- **Self-Healing**: Workflows should recover from failures automatically
- **Smart Spawning**: Agents should be created dynamically based on task needs

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
1. **Node Version**: >=18.0.0 required
2. **Platform**: Darwin (macOS) environment
3. **Database**: Must work with existing Supabase schema
4. **APIs**: Must respect rate limits for external event APIs

### Resource Constraints
1. **Agent Limit**: Maximum 10 concurrent agents
2. **Token Optimization**: Must be enabled to reduce usage
3. **Cache**: Must utilize caching for performance

### Integration Constraints
1. **Existing Code**: Must preserve current functionality
2. **File Organization**: Follow project structure conventions
3. **Testing**: Maintain test coverage

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
1. ✓ All agents spawn successfully with proper capabilities
2. ✓ Agents coordinate effectively through memory and hooks
3. ✓ Tasks are distributed optimally across agents
4. ✓ Code quality and test coverage maintained/improved

### Performance Success
1. ✓ Parallel execution achieves 2.8-4.4x speed improvement
2. ✓ Token usage reduced by ~32% through optimization
3. ✓ Bottlenecks identified and resolved
4. ✓ Cache hit rate >80% for repeated operations

### Operational Success
1. ✓ Self-healing workflows recover from failures
2. ✓ Cross-session memory preserves context
3. ✓ GitHub integration maintains clean commit history
4. ✓ Telemetry provides actionable insights

## Recommended Spawn Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup
1. Initialize hierarchical swarm topology
2. Spawn coordinator agent for orchestration
3. Setup memory namespaces for each domain

### Phase 2: Development Agent Deployment
1. Spawn backend and frontend developers
2. Deploy database architect for schema optimization
3. Create API integration specialist

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance Layer
1. Spawn test engineer for coverage
2. Deploy performance analyzer
3. Add security auditor

### Phase 4: DevOps Integration
1. Spawn CI/CD engineer
2. Setup edge function developer
3. Configure monitoring agents

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: SQLite bindings error in hooks
- **Mitigation**: Use alternative memory storage or reinstall dependencies

### Coordination Risks
- **Risk**: Agent communication bottlenecks
- **Mitigation**: Use hierarchical topology with clear delegation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Token usage exceeding limits
- **Mitigation**: Enable aggressive caching and token optimization

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Tasks
1. Fix SQLite binding issue for memory persistence
2. Create comprehensive test suite
3. Optimize API rate limiting
4. Implement proper error handling

### Agent-Specific Instructions
Each agent should:
- Use hooks for coordination
- Store decisions in memory
- Follow SPARC methodology
- Maintain documentation
- Report progress regularly

## Conclusion

The spawn operation should create a comprehensive multi-agent system capable of:
- Maintaining and enhancing the SceneScout platform
- Coordinating complex development tasks
- Ensuring code quality and performance
- Providing self-healing capabilities

The hierarchical topology with 8-10 specialized agents should effectively handle the project's requirements while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing needs.
