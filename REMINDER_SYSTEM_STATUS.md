# Reminder System Test Results

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Save Flow
- **localStorage save**: ✅ Events show in "My Events" page
- **Database save**: ✅ Events saved to `saved_events` table
- **Reminder creation**: ✅ Reminders created in `event_reminders` table

### 2. Push Subscriptions
- **Service worker**: ✅ Registered successfully
- **Push subscription**: ✅ Saved to `push_subscriptions` table
- **Subscription count**: 1 active subscription

### 3. Database Tables
```sql
push_subscriptions: 1 subscription (anonymous user)
saved_events: 3 events (including 2 test events)
event_reminders: 2 reminders (from earlier test)
```

### 4. API Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/saved-events` - POST/DELETE/GET working
- ✅ `/api/reminders/create` - POST/DELETE working
- ✅ `/api/cron/reminders` - GET working
- ✅ `/api/test/create-reminder-test-events` - POST/DELETE working

## ⚠️ Issue Found

### Cron Timing Logic
The cron job at `/api/cron/reminders` checks for events that are:
- **24h reminder**: 23-25 hours away
- **3h reminder**: 2.5-3.5 hours away

**Problem**: The cron parses `start_date` (date only) without considering `time`, so:
- Event at "2025-10-06" becomes "2025-10-06 00:00:00 UTC"
- Actual event time "2025-10-06 14:28" is ignored
- Hours calculation is incorrect

### Test Results
```bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test/create-reminder-test-events
✅ Created 2 test events:
  - Event 24h away: Oct 6, 2025 14:28
  - Event 3h away: Oct 5, 2025 17:28

$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/reminders
✅ Checked 3 events
❌ Sent 0 reminders (should have sent 2)
```

## 🔧 Fix Needed

Update `/api/cron/reminders` line 91:

**Current (broken)**:
```typescript
const eventDate = new Date(eventData.start_date) // Only date, no time
```

**Fix**:
```typescript
// Combine date and time for accurate calculation
const eventDateStr = eventData.start_date || eventData.date
const eventTime = eventData.time || eventData.start_time || '19:00'
const eventDate = new Date(`${eventDateStr}T${eventTime}`)
```

This will correctly calculate hours until event, triggering reminders at the right time.

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Apply fix** to cron timing logic
2. **Test again**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test/create-reminder-test-events
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/reminders
   ```
3. **Verify**: Should see `{sent: 2}` and receive 2 push notifications

## 🎯 Expected Final State

When working correctly:
- User saves event → localStorage + database + reminders created
- Cron runs every hour → checks saved events
- 24h before event → sends push notification
- 3h before event → sends push notification
- User clicks notification → opens event detail page
- Calendar export → downloads .ics file
