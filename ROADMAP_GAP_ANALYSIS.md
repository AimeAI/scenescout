# 🎯 SceneScout: Gap Analysis - Vision vs Current State
**Date**: October 4, 2025
**Current Completion**: ~40% of MVP
**Status**: Several critical blockers preventing user adoption

---

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State
- ✅ **Working**: Live API integration, event loading, basic UI
- ❌ **Broken**: Event details, reminders, spontaneity features
- ⚠️ **Partial**: Personalization engine exists but incomplete

### Critical Gap
**The core value loop is broken**: Users can discover events but cannot actually attend them because:
1. No event detail view (can't see full info or buy tickets)
2. No reminder system (can't get reminded to attend)
3. No spontaneity layer (can't find "what's happening now")

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (P0 - Must Fix to Ship MVP)

### 1. ❌ Event Click Does Nothing ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Vision**: Click event → See full details → Buy tickets → Save to calendar
**Reality**: Click event → Nothing happens

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Code exists: `handleEventClick` in `src/app/page.tsx:152`
- ✅ Navigation works: Uses sessionStorage + router.push
- ✅ Event detail page exists: `src/app/events/[id]/page.tsx`
- ⚠️ **BUT**: Needs browser testing to confirm flow works end-to-end

**What's Missing**:
```typescript
// Current: Basic implementation exists
const handleEventClick = (event: Event) => {
  sessionStorage.setItem(`event_${event.id}`, JSON.stringify(event))
  router.push(`/events/${event.id}`)
}

// Event detail page retrieves it:
useEffect(() => {
  const storedEvent = sessionStorage.getItem(`event_${eventId}`)
  if (storedEvent) {
    setEvent(JSON.parse(storedEvent))
  }
}, [eventId])
```

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Cannot see event details, cannot buy tickets, cannot attend events
**Effort**: 2h (mostly testing and polish)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED but needs browser verification

---

### 2. ❌ No Reminder Loop (Core Value Prop Broken) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Vision**: Save event → Get calendar invite → Push notification 24h before → Email reminder 3h before
**Reality**: Can save events, but no reminders = users forget to attend

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Save functionality works: `src/lib/saved/store.ts`
- ✅ Saved events page exists: `src/app/saved/page.tsx`
- ✅ Calendar export implemented: `src/lib/calendar/export.ts`
- ✅ .ics download working on event detail page
- ❌ Push notifications NOT configured
- ❌ Email reminders NOT implemented
- ❌ Reminder scheduling NOT built

**What's Missing**:
1. **Push Notifications** (Vision: Week 2)
   - Web-push library installed but not configured
   - Need to request notification permission
   - Need to store push subscriptions in Supabase
   - Need cron job to send reminders

2. **Email Reminders** (Vision: Week 2)
   - Resend API stub exists but not configured
   - Need email templates
   - Need user opt-in flow

3. **Reminder Scheduling** (Vision: Week 2)
   - Need cron job (Vercel Cron or Inngest)
   - Need to check saved events daily
   - Send push 24h before event
   - Send push 3h before event

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Core value prop (never miss events) doesn't work
**Effort**: 12h (6h push, 4h email, 2h scheduling)
**Status**: Calendar export done ✅, notifications NOT started ❌

---

### 3. ❌ No "Near Me Now" Spontaneity Layer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Vision**: Friday 8pm bored → "Near Me Now" → See cool spots within 15min → Go
**Reality**: No real-time spontaneity feature at all

**Current Status**:
- ❌ Location detection NOT implemented
- ❌ "Near Me Now" rail NOT created
- ❌ Time-based filtering (next 3 hours) NOT built
- ❌ Distance sorting NOT implemented
- ❌ Dedicated spontaneity view NOT created

**What's Missing** (Vision: Week 3):
1. **Location Detection**
   - Request geolocation permission
   - Store user location in state
   - Calculate distance to events
   - "Update Location" button

2. **"Near Me Now" Rail**
   - Filter events starting within next 3 hours
   - Sort by distance (closest first)
   - Show distance badge on cards
   - "Happening Right Now" indicator

3. **Dedicated Spontaneity View**
   - New route: `/now` or tab on homepage
   - Large "UPDATE LOCATION" button
   - Map view showing nearby events
   - "Surprise Me" random event picker
   - Filter by distance (5min, 15min, 30min walk)

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Key differentiator from competitors is missing
**Effort**: 14h (3h location, 5h rail, 6h dedicated view)
**Status**: NOT started

---

### 4. ⚠️ Supabase Configuration Issues
**Vision**: User accounts, cross-device sync, cached events
**Reality**: Supabase partially configured, cache broken

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Supabase connected: URL and anon key valid
- ❌ Service role key truncated (244 → 218 chars)
- ❌ Cache system disabled (broken)
- ❌ User accounts NOT implemented
- ❌ Cross-device sync NOT working

**What's Working**:
- Database exists and is queryable
- Anon key works for reads
- Cache retrieval endpoint exists

**What's Broken**:
1. **Service Role Key Truncation**
   - JWT signature contains underscores
   - Next.js env parser stops at underscore
   - Tried: quotes, file reads, JSON file - all failed
   - Workaround: Using anon key (limited permissions)

2. **Database Enum Constraints**
   - `category` column has enum that rejects values like "music-concerts"
   - Need migration: `ALTER TABLE events ALTER COLUMN category TYPE TEXT`
   - Migration file exists: `supabase/migrations/20251003_fix_category_enum.sql`
   - **NOT applied** (requires manual execution in Supabase Dashboard)

3. **RLS Policies**
   - Row Level Security blocks anon key inserts
   - Need proper auth or adjust policies
   - Cache refresh appears successful but events aren't stored

**Impact**: Medium - Cache system broken but live APIs working as fallback
**Effort**: 4h (fix migration, test, or remove Supabase entirely)
**Status**: Deferred (not blocking users currently)

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY GAPS (P1 - Needed for Core Experience)

### 5. ⚠️ Search Page Broken
**Vision**: User searches for any event type, finds results
**Reality**: Search on homepage works, `/search` page broken

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Homepage search bar works
- ✅ Search API endpoint works: `/api/search-events`
- ❌ Dedicated search page broken: `src/app/search/page.tsx`
- ❌ Enter key doesn't trigger search
- ❌ Search → map integration missing

**What's Missing**:
- Fix Enter key handler (onKeyPress → onKeyDown)
- Connect search input to map display
- Add loading states
- OR: Remove dedicated search page, use homepage only

**Impact**: Medium - Homepage search works as workaround
**Effort**: 2h
**Status**: Partially working

---

### 6. ⚠️ Map View Broken
**Vision**: Toggle between list and map views seamlessly
**Reality**: Map toggle exists but no actual map renders

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Map toggle button exists on homepage
- ✅ Leaflet library installed
- ❌ Map doesn't render when toggled
- ❌ Events not plotted with markers
- ❌ No interactive map functionality

**What's Missing**:
1. Implement map component using Leaflet
2. Plot events with GPS coordinates
3. Add interactive markers
4. Click marker → show event details
5. Cluster markers when zoomed out

**Impact**: Medium - List view works fine
**Effort**: 8h
**Status**: NOT implemented

---

### 7. ⚠️ No User Accounts
**Vision**: Sign up → Sync across devices → Never lose data
**Reality**: All data in localStorage (browser-only)

**Current Status**:
- ❌ No signup/login flow
- ❌ No user profiles
- ❌ No cross-device sync
- ❌ Clear cookies = lose all data

**What's Missing** (Vision: Week 7-8):
1. Supabase Auth integration
2. Email/password signup
3. Social login (Google, Apple)
4. Profile page
5. Migrate localStorage data to Supabase
6. Sync saved events, taste graph, seen events

**Impact**: Medium - Single-device usage works
**Effort**: 14h (8h auth, 6h sync)
**Status**: NOT started (deferred to Phase 2)

## 💡 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Focus on Core Loop First**
- ✅ Discovery works (Ticketmaster + EventBrite APIs)
- ❌ Remind loop broken (no notifications)
- ❌ Attend loop incomplete (no ticket buying polish)

**Recommendation**: Fix reminders + event detail flow before adding new features

---

### 2. **Simplify Supabase Issues**
**Option A: Fix It** (4h)
- Apply database migration manually
- Fix RLS policies
- Get service role key working

**Option B: Defer It** (0h)
- Keep using localStorage for MVP
- Add accounts in Phase 2
- Cache system not critical (live APIs work fine)

**Recommendation**: Option B (defer) - localStorage works for single-user MVP

---

### 3. **Map View Decision**
**Current State**: Toggle exists, no map renders, not blocking users

**Option A: Fix It** (8h)
- Implement Leaflet map
- Plot events with markers
- Add interactivity

**Option B: Remove It** (1h)
- Delete map toggle
- Keep only list view
- Add map in Phase 2 if users request it

**Recommendation**: Option B (remove) - focus on core features first

---

### 4. **Search Page Decision**
**Current State**: Homepage search works, dedicated page broken

**Option A: Fix It** (2h)
- Fix Enter key handler
- Add loading states

**Option B: Remove It** (0.5h)
- Delete `/search` page
- Keep homepage search only

**Recommendation**: Option A (fix) - small effort, useful feature

---

- [ ] "Near Me Now" (14h)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Founder uses app 2x/week
- ✅ Founder attends 1+ event via SceneScout
- ✅ Faster than Facebook Events

---

### **WEEK 3-4: POLISH & TEST (16h)**
Focus: Fix bugs, clean code, prepare for beta

- [ ] Code cleanup (8h)
- [ ] Fix/remove map view (1-8h)
- [ ] Fix search page (2h)
- [ ] Founder testing (ongoing)

**Success Criteria**:

---

## 🎯 FINAL SUMMARY

### Current Completion: 40% of MVP

**What Works** ✅:
- Discovery engine (Ticketmaster + EventBrite)
- Homepage with 18 categories
- Personalization (basic taste graph)
- Calendar export (.ics)
- Save events to localStorage

**Critical Gaps** ❌:
1. Event detail flow (needs testing, mostly done)
2. Reminder system (NOT started - 12h)
3. "Near Me Now" spontaneity (NOT started - 14h)

**Total Work to MVP**: ~28 hours

**Biggest Risk**: Reminder system is P0 but not started. Without it, core value prop fails.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Test event detail flow (2h)
2. Build reminder system (12h) ← CRITICAL
3. Build "Near Me Now" (14h)
4. Founder test for 2 weeks
5. Invite 10 beta users

**Timeline to Usable MVP**: 2 weeks of focused work

---

**Bottom Line**: The vision is sound, the tech stack works, but 3 critical features are missing. Fix them, and you have a viable product. Skip them, and it's just another event listing app.
