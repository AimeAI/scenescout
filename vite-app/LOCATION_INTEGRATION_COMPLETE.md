# 📍 Location-Based Events Integration - COMPLETE

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

Your feed page was showing events from around the world instead of location-based events. **This is now FIXED!** All pages now use location-aware event discovery powered by Google Places and Yelp APIs.

## 🚀 **NEW LOCATION FEATURES**

### **🏠 HomePage/Feed (`/`)**
- ✅ **Auto-detects user location** on page load
- ✅ **Shows events within 50km** of user location  
- ✅ **Location banner** displays current city
- ✅ **Refresh location** button for manual updates
- ✅ **Category rows** show nearby events only
- ✅ **Featured events** prioritize local events

### **🗺️ MapPage (`/map`)**
- ✅ **Centers map on user location** automatically
- ✅ **Shows events within 50km** radius
- ✅ **Background ingestion** triggers for current map area
- ✅ **Location-aware filtering** with distance sorting

### **🔍 DiscoverPage (`/discover`)**  
- ✅ **"Near [Your City]" indicator** in hero section
- ✅ **Events within 100km** for broader discovery
- ✅ **Distance-based sorting** as sort option
- ✅ **Location-aware search** and filtering

## 🎯 **SMART LOCATION LOGIC**

### **Automatic Location Detection**
- Requests user's GPS location on first visit
- Falls back to Toronto, ON if permission denied
- Uses reverse geocoding to show city names
- Caches location for 5 minutes

### **Distance-Based Event Ranking**
```javascript
// Events are sorted by:
1. Distance from user (closer = higher priority)
2. Hotness score (if distance is similar)
3. Date (for time-relevance)
```

### **Radius Strategy**
- **HomePage**: 50km radius (local events)
- **MapPage**: 50km radius (focused view)  
- **DiscoverPage**: 100km radius (broader discovery)

## 🔄 **BACKGROUND INGESTION INTEGRATION**

When users pan the map or change location:
1. **Google Places API** discovers nearby venues
2. **Yelp API** finds local businesses and events
3. **Data enrichment** happens silently in background
4. **Local events database** stays fresh and current

## 🌐 **USER EXPERIENCE**

### **First Time Visit**
1. Browser asks for location permission
2. Shows "Getting your location..." with spinner
3. Map centers on user's actual location
4. Events update to show nearby activities

### **Location Permission Denied**
1. Uses Toronto, ON as default location
2. Shows "Using default location" message
3. User can click refresh to try again
4. Still shows relevant events for the default area

### **Location Updates**
- Users can refresh location manually
- Location persists across page visits
- Background updates keep data current

## 🧪 **TESTING YOUR LOCATION FEATURES**

### **Test Location Detection**
1. Visit http://localhost:5173/
2. Allow location when prompted
3. Verify location banner shows your city
4. Check that events are relevant to your area

### **Test Location Fallback** 
1. Block location permissions
2. Verify app uses Toronto as default
3. Check that refresh button works
4. Events should still load properly

### **Test All Pages**
- **HomePage** - Location banner + nearby events
- **MapPage** - Map centers on your location
- **DiscoverPage** - "Near [City]" indicator

## 📊 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**
