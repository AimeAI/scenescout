# Emergency Response Procedures

## Purpose
Critical emergency response procedures for catastrophic system failures, security breaches, and business-critical incidents affecting SceneScout.

## Emergency Classification

### Emergency Level 1 - Critical System Failure
**Response Time: Immediate (5 minutes)**
- Complete platform outage (site unreachable)
- Database corruption or complete failure
- Critical security breach with active threat
- Payment system complete failure
- Data loss incident

### Emergency Level 2 - Major Service Degradation  
**Response Time: 15 minutes**
- Partial system outage affecting core features
- Database performance causing timeouts
- Security incident with potential data exposure
- Payment processing errors
- Critical third-party service failures

### Emergency Level 3 - Service Impact
**Response Time: 1 hour**
- Performance degradation affecting user experience
- Non-critical feature failures
- Minor security incidents
- Single API source failures

## Emergency Response Team

### Primary Response Team
1. **Incident Commander**: [Primary on-call engineer]
   - Phone: [Emergency contact]
   - Backup: [Secondary engineer]

2. **Technical Lead**: [Senior engineer]
   - Database issues, system architecture
   - Backup: [Database administrator]

3. **Security Lead**: [Security officer]
   - All security-related incidents
   - Backup: [External security consultant]

4. **Communications Lead**: [Engineering manager]
   - Internal/external communications
   - Backup: [Product manager]

### Escalation Chain
- **0-30 minutes**: Primary on-call team
- **30-60 minutes**: Engineering management
- **1-2 hours**: Executive team (CTO/CEO)
- **2+ hours**: Board notification (if public company)
