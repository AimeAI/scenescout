## ðŸ”§ Common Operations

### Quick Health Check
```bash
# Run health check script
npm run smoke

# Check system status
./scripts/app-health-check.mjs

# Monitor event ingestion
node scripts/monitoring/check-ingestion-health.js
```

### Database Quick Status
```bash
# Check database connection
npm run db:ping

# View recent migrations
supabase migration list

# Check table sizes
psql -c "SELECT schemaname,tablename,pg_size_pretty(size) as size FROM (SELECT schemaname,tablename,pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) AS size FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname='public') ORDER BY size DESC;"
```

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# View application logs
tail -f logs/application.log

# Monitor error logs
tail -f logs/error.log

# Check ingestion logs
tail -f logs/ingestion.log
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Stack

- **Application Monitoring**: Sentry
- **Database Monitoring**: Supabase built-in metrics
- **Uptime Monitoring**: [Uptime service]
- **Performance Monitoring**: Custom health checks
- **Log Aggregation**: [Log service]

## ðŸ”„ Automation

Many operational tasks are automated through scripts in the `/scripts` directory:
- Database backups (daily)
- Health checks (every 5 minutes)
- Event ingestion monitoring (continuous)
- Performance metrics collection (hourly)
- Security scans (daily)

## ðŸ“– Documentation Standards

All runbooks follow a standard format:
1. **Purpose** - What the procedure accomplishes
2. **Prerequisites** - Required access, tools, or conditions
3. **Steps** - Detailed step-by-step instructions
4. **Verification** - How to confirm success
5. **Rollback** - How to undo changes if needed
6. **Escalation** - When and how to escalate

## ðŸ†˜ Getting Help

1. Check the specific runbook for your issue
2. Review the troubleshooting guide
3. Check recent incidents for similar issues
4. Follow escalation procedures if needed
5. Document any new solutions found

Remember: When in doubt, escalate early rather than risk system stability.
