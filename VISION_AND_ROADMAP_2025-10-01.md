## 🌟 THE VISION: Cultural OS for Your City

**SceneScout isn't another event listing app. It's the cultural compass for your city — the Uber for going out, the Netflix for local culture.**

### The Problem We Solve
People waste **5+ hours/week** hunting for things to do:
- Scrolling Facebook Events (noise, not taste)
- Googling "things to do this weekend" (generic lists)
- Checking Eventbrite (ticketing, not discovery)
- Asking friends in group chats (hit or miss)
- Checking individual venue websites (tedious)
- **Result:** Decision paralysis, FOMO, staying home

### The SceneScout Solution
**5 minutes/week to plan your social life, tuned to your exact taste.**

1. **Taste Graph** - Every click, save, thumbs-up builds your cultural fingerprint
2. **Dynamic Rails** - Categories evolve automatically (AI-punk shows, basement comedy, Persian pop-ups)
3. **Spontaneity Layer** - "What's cool near me RIGHT NOW?"
4. **Save & Remind Loop** - One tap → calendar sync → never miss
5. **Contextual Discovery** - Planning mode (this weekend) + Spontaneous mode (tonight)

### The Magic Moments

**Before SceneScout:**
```
See event on Instagram → Screenshot → Forget → Miss it → FOMO
OR: Spend 2 hours researching → Still uncertain → Give up → Stay home
```

**After SceneScout:**
```
Open app → See 15 things you'll love → Save 3 → Get reminded → Go
Friday 8pm bored → "Near Me Now" → See 5 cool spots within 15min → Pick one → Go
```

### Market Position

| Platform | Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Facebook Events** | Social proof | Not taste-based, cluttered, privacy concerns |
| **Eventbrite** | Ticketing | Not discovery-focused, optimized for sellers |
| **Meetup** | Communities | Not spontaneous, group-centric not event-centric |
| **Fever** | Curated | Not personalized, limited to paid experiences |
| **Time Out** | Editorial | Not personalized, one-size-fits-all |
| **SceneScout** | **Taste + Spontaneity + Reminder Loop** | **← Our Wedge** |

## 📊 WHY NOW? MARKET TIMING

### Perfect Storm of Conditions

**1. Post-COVID Hunger for IRL Experiences**
- People are tired of being home after 2+ years of lockdowns
- "Revenge spending" on experiences, not things
- TikTok "main character energy" trend = people want to live life, not watch it
- Cultural shift: experiences > possessions

**2. Facebook Events is Declining**
- Privacy concerns pushing users away from Facebook
- Feed algorithm deprioritizes events (shows ads instead)
- Gen Z doesn't use Facebook (Instagram doesn't have events)
- No innovation in 10+ years (same UX since 2012)
- Trust in Facebook at all-time low

**3. AI/ML is Ready for Personalization**
- GPT-4 for content enrichment (descriptions, categorization)
- Real-time recommendation algorithms are table stakes
- Taste graph modeling is solved problem (Netflix, Spotify, TikTok)
- Vector databases for similarity search (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- We can build in weeks what took Netflix years

**4. Mobile-First Culture is Here**
- 70% of event discovery happens on mobile
- Push notifications are normalized (people expect them)
- Location services always-on (Uber, Google Maps trained users)
- Last-minute decisions made on phones, not desktops
- Mobile payment is frictionless (Apple Pay, Google Pay)

**5. Event Landscape is Fragmenting**
- More independent venues, fewer chains
- Creator economy = more niche events (AI-punk shows, underground comedy)
- Pop-ups, temporary experiences, secret events
- No single platform captures it all anymore
- **Need for aggregation is higher than ever**

**6. Discovery is Broken Everywhere**
- Google search results are SEO spam
- Instagram explore is ads
- TikTok is for content, not planning
- Nobody has solved "what should I do tonight?" problem
- **This is the gap we fill**

### Why This Timing is Critical

**5 years ago:** Too early
- Smartphones not ubiquitous
- Location privacy concerns high
- Recommendation algorithms primitive
- Facebook Events still worked well

**Today:** Just right
- All infrastructure in place
- User behavior shifted
- Competitors stagnant
- Window is open

**5 years from now:** Too late
- Incumbents will wake up
- Market will consolidate
- First mover advantage lost

**→ We have a 2-3 year window to capture this market before someone else does.**

## 🛡️ DEFENSIBILITY & MOATS

### How We Win Long-Term

**Network Effects (Our Primary Moat)**
1. **Data flywheel**: More users → more interaction data → better taste graph → better recommendations → more users
2. **Time-based moat**: 1 year of user taste data > 1 week (can't be copied overnight)
3. **Supply side**: Venues want to be where users are → exclusive events → more value → more users

**Data Moat**
1. **Unique events**: Direct venue relationships = events not on Facebook/Eventbrite
2. **Proprietary categorization**: Our AI-punk, basement comedy, Persian pop-up categories
3. **User taste profiles**: Millions of interaction signals = competitive advantage

**Brand & Community**
1. **"SceneScout users are tastemakers"** - being on SceneScout = you're culturally savvy
2. **Trust in curation**: Users trust our recommendations over random Facebook events
3. **Community identity**: "I found this on SceneScout" becomes a badge of honor

**Technology**
1. **Taste graph engine**: Our core algorithm gets better with scale
2. **Real-time spontaneity**: "Near Me Now" requires geo + timing infrastructure
3. **Reminder loop**: Calendar sync + push + email orchestration is complex

### Competitive Response Scenarios

**"What if Facebook builds this?"**
- **Likely?** No - not their focus (they optimize for engagement/ads, not utility)
- **If they do?** We're validated = acquisition target ($50M-$200M)
- **Our advantage:** Focus beats feature. Our taste graph will be better because it's all we do.

**"What if Eventbrite builds this?"**
- **Likely?** No - they're optimized for sellers (venues), not buyers (attendees)
- **If they do?** They have the data but wrong incentives (maximize ticket sales, not best matches)
- **Our advantage:** User-first vs seller-first design philosophy

**"What if a well-funded startup tries to copy us?"**
- **Likely?** Medium - someone will try
- **Our advantage:** Speed + data moat. If we get to 10K users in 6 months, we're defensible
- **Strategy:** Move fast, lock in Toronto, expand to 3-5 cities before copycats gain traction

### Exit Strategy (If We Don't Go All the Way)

**Acquisition Targets:**
1. **Eventbrite** ($50M-$100M) - wants discovery layer
2. **Spotify** ($100M-$200M) - wants live events for artists
3. **Uber** ($200M-$500M) - "Uber for experiences" fits their vision
4. **Google Maps** ($500M+) - wants to own local discovery

**Timeline to Exit:**
- 12-18 months to prove product-market fit
- 10K-50K users in 2-3 cities
- $500K-$1M annual revenue
- Valuation: $30M-$100M

2. **No Ticket Buying** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Status: External URLs exist in data but not exposed
   - Impact: Can't actually attend events
   - Needed: "Buy Tickets" button with `event.external_url`

3. **Save Reminder Loop Incomplete** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Status: Can save events (✅) but no reminders, no calendar sync

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION & KILL CRITERIA

### Key Risks

**Risk 1: Cold Start Problem**
**Issue:** Taste graph needs data to work, but users won't use it until it works
**Mitigation:**
- Onboarding flow: Rate 10 sample events upfront
- Seed with founder's taste profile (good defaults)
- Hybrid approach: Editorial curation + personalization

**Risk 2: Event Data Quality**
**Issue:** Scraping breaks, missing key events, outdated info
**Mitigation:**
- Multiple data sources (Ticketmaster, EventBrite, Meetup, Songkick)
- Manual fallback: Partner with 20 venues for direct feed
- User reports: "Event wrong? Report it" → fixes within 1 hour
- Daily data quality checks (automated alerts)

**Risk 3: Low Conversion (Browse but Don't Attend)**
**Issue:** Users save events but never actually go
**Mitigation:**
- Track save → attend rate (goal: >10%)
- If <5%, problem is reminder loop (fix notifications)
- If 5-10%, problem is event quality (fix recommendations)
- Survey users: "Why didn't you attend saved events?"

**Risk 4: Geographic Constraint**
**Issue:** Only works in dense cities, can't scale to suburbs
**Mitigation:**
- Start with Toronto (proven market, high density)
- Expand to similar cities (Montreal, Vancouver)
- Don't try to serve everywhere (focus > breadth)
- Rural/suburban users can use for travel (not daily)

**Risk 5: Seasonality**
**Issue:** Event volume drops in summer (vacations) or winter (COVID)
**Mitigation:**
- Diversify event types (indoor winter events, summer festivals)
- Adjust categories seasonally
- Expand to restaurants, bars (always-on venues)
- Multiple cities = seasonal offset

**Risk 6: Venue Resistance**
**Issue:** Venues don't want to share data, prefer to own customer
**Mitigation:**
- Provide value first: Free promotion, targeted audience
- Affiliate model: Venues get sales, we get commission
- Transparency: Show venues how many users we drive
- Long-term: B2B product for venues

---

### Kill Criteria (When to Pivot or Shut Down)

**After 3 months:**
- IF <100 weekly active users → Pivot to B2B (venue SaaS) or shut down
- IF <15% weekly retention → UX is fundamentally broken, restart
- IF <3% save → attend conversion → Problem is offline (events bad) not app

**After 6 months:**
- IF <500 weekly active users → Growth strategy failed, reassess
- IF <20% weekly retention → No product-market fit, pivot
- IF <$1,000/month revenue → Monetization doesn't work, rethink
- IF competitors launch similar product with $5M funding → Sell or pivot

**After 12 months:**
- IF <2,000 weekly active users → Can't hit escape velocity, wind down
- IF <$10K/month revenue → Not fundable, not sustainable
- IF team burned out, market changed → Honorable shutdown

**Green Flags (Keep Going):**
- ✅ 30%+ month-over-month growth
- ✅ 25%+ weekly retention
- ✅ 10%+ save → attend conversion
- ✅ NPS >50
- ✅ Users unprompted say "I stopped using Facebook Events"
- ✅ Venues reach out to us (supply side pull)

### Path to Profitability

**Unit Economics (Year 2):**
```
10,000 users in Toronto:
- 25% weekly active = 2,500 WAU
- 2,500 × 20% save events = 500 saves/week
- 500 × 10% attend = 50 tickets/week = 200 tickets/month
- 200 tickets × $40 avg × 8% commission = $640/month (affiliate)
- 20 sponsored events × $100 = $2,000/month
- 1,000 premium users × $5 = $5,000/month
- Total revenue: $7,640/month = $92K/year

Costs:
- Team: 3 engineers × $120K = $360K/year
- Infrastructure: $10K/year
- Marketing: $50K/year
- Total costs: $420K/year

Break-even: 50,000 users (achievable by month 18)

## 💡 DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. **Taste Over Social** - Show events you'll love, not what's popular
2. **Spontaneity Over Planning** - Make it easy to decide "tonight"
3. **Remind Over Forget** - Close the loop from discovery to attendance
4. **Simple Over Feature-Rich** - 5 min/week, not 5 hours
5. **Mobile-First** - Most decisions happen on phones
6. **Trust Over Noise** - Quality curation, not overwhelming quantity
7. **Evolving Over Static** - Feed adapts to your taste over time

---

## 🎬 FINAL NOTES

**This is a 1% app idea.** The vision is sound. The market timing is right. The wedge is clear.

**Current state:** 40% of MVP complete. Core tech works, UX has critical gaps.

**4-week sprint:** Ship event details, reminders, and spontaneity layer. Get 1 user (you) to switch from Facebook Events.

**3-month sprint:** Get 10 beta users to prefer SceneScout. Prove the wedge works.

**6-month sprint:** Scale to 1,000 users in Toronto. Become the cultural OS for one city.

**Then:** Raise funding, expand cities, build the future of going out.
