## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Standards
1. **TypeScript Compliance**
   - Strict type checking enabled
   - No `any` types in production code
   - All functions properly typed
   - Interfaces for all data structures

2. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks for all async operations
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Error propagation with context
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Documentation**
   - JSDoc comments for all public APIs
   - Usage examples in comments
   - Type definitions documented
   - Architecture decisions recorded

### Performance Requirements

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Single Agent Spawn | < 100ms | < 200ms |
| Concurrent Spawn (5 agents) | < 500ms | < 1000ms |
| Task Execution Overhead | < 50ms | < 100ms |
| Memory per Agent | < 50MB | < 100MB |
| Coordination Latency | < 10ms | < 50ms |

### Integration Points

1. **Claude Code Task Tool**
   - Must use Task tool for actual agent execution
   - Proper error propagation from Task tool
   - Metrics collection from executions

2. **MCP Coordination Tools**
   - Integration with swarm_init
   - Compatibility with agent_spawn
   - Task orchestration alignment

3. **Hooks System**
   - All required hooks implemented
   - Proper timing of hook execution
   - Error handling in hook failures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual function testing
- Mock dependencies
- Error case validation
- Performance assertions

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end spawn workflows
- Real coordination scenarios
- Hook integration verification
- MCP tool compatibility

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with multiple agents
- Concurrent execution stress tests
- Memory leak detection
- Resource cleanup validation

### Regression Tests
- Backward compatibility checks
- API contract validation
- Feature flag testing
- Version migration tests

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Concurrent Operations**
   - Race conditions in agent spawning
   - Deadlocks in coordination
   - Resource contention

2. **Memory Management**
   - Memory leaks in long-running operations
   - Resource cleanup failures
   - Unbounded growth scenarios

3. **Error Propagation**
   - Silent failures
   - Error swallowing
   - Incomplete error context

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Concurrency**
   - Use proper locking mechanisms
   - Implement timeout mechanisms
   - Add circuit breakers

2. **Memory**
   - Implement resource pooling
   - Add garbage collection triggers
   - Monitor memory usage

3. **Errors**
   - Comprehensive error types
   - Error context preservation
   - Centralized error handling
