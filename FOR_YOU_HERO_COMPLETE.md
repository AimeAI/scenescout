## 📍 Integration

### Added to Homepage:
**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx:428-435`

```tsx
{/* For You Hero Section */}
{!loading && (
  <ForYouHero
    allEvents={Object.values(categoryEvents).flat()}
    onEventClick={handleEventClick}
    categories={CATEGORIES}
  />
)}
```

**Placement**: Right after main hero section, before PersonalizedRails

---

## 🧪 How It Works

### Data Flow:

1. **Read Interactions**
   ```tsx
   const interactions = readInteractions()
   ```
   - Gets user's click/save history from localStorage

2. **Compute Affinity**
   ```tsx
   const affinity = computeAffinity(interactions)
   ```
   - Calculates category scores using exponential decay
   - Returns scores from 0 to 1

3. **Get Top Categories**
   ```tsx
   const top = Object.entries(affinity.categories)
     .sort(([, a], [, b]) => b - a)
     .slice(0, 3)
   ```
   - Sorts by score descending
   - Takes top 3 categories

4. **Filter Recommended Events**
   ```tsx
   const recommended = allEvents
     .filter(event => topCategoryIds.includes(event.category))
     .sort((a, b) => {
       const aScore = affinity.categories[a.category] || 0
       const bScore = affinity.categories[b.category] || 0
       if (aScore !== bScore) return bScore - aScore
       return new Date(a.date).getTime() - new Date(b.date).getTime()
     })
     .slice(0, 10)
   ```
   - Only shows events from high-affinity categories
   - Sorts by affinity first, then chronologically
   - Limits to 10 events

5. **Render or Hide**
   ```tsx
   if (topCategories.length === 0 || recommendedEvents.length === 0) {
     return null // Hide for new users
   }
   ```

## 🎬 User Journey Example

### New User (No Interactions):
- **For You section**: Hidden (not rendered)
- **Homepage**: Shows all category rails

### After 5 Music Event Clicks:
- **For You section**: Appears!
- **Shows**:
  - "Based on your taste: 🎵 Music & Concerts (42%)"
  - 10 recommended music events
  - "See your full taste profile →" link

### After Diverse Interactions (Music + Comedy + Tech):
- **For You section**: Updated
- **Shows**:
  - "Based on your taste: 🎵 Music (38%) 😂 Comedy (25%) 💻 Tech (18%)"
  - 10 recommended events from these 3 categories
  - Higher affinity categories show more events

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Props Interface:
```tsx
interface ForYouHeroProps {
  allEvents: any[]           // All events from all categories
  onEventClick: (event: any) => void  // Handler for event clicks
  categories: Array<{ id: string; title: string; emoji: string }>  // Category metadata
}
```

### Dependencies:
- ✅ `framer-motion` - Animations
- ✅ `lucide-react` - Icons (Sparkles, TrendingUp, ChevronRight)
- ✅ `@/lib/tracking/client` - Interaction tracking
- ✅ `@/lib/tracking/affinity` - Affinity scoring
- ✅ `@/lib/saved/store` - Save functionality
- ✅ `@/components/events/PriceBadge` - Price display

### State Management:
```tsx
const [savedEvents, setSavedEvents] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
```
- Tracks which events are saved
- Updates when user clicks heart icon
- Persists to localStorage

### Memoization:
```tsx
const interactions = useMemo(() => {
  if (!isTrackingEnabled() || typeof window === 'undefined') return []
  return readInteractions()
}, [])

const { topCategories, recommendedEvents } = useMemo(() => {
  // ... expensive calculations
}, [interactions, allEvents, categories])
```
- Prevents unnecessary recalculations
- Only recomputes when dependencies change
